# Useful-Scripts-for-VAPT

This repository contains a collection of scripts and tools designed to assist in various stages of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT). These scripts are particularly useful for automating repetitive tasks, analyzing network configurations, and performing subnet-related calculations.

## üîß Project Structure

### Useful Scripts
The `Useful Scripts/` directory includes multiple subdirectories, each containing scripts categorized by function, such as:
- **Check Classes for INPT**: Tools to validate and organize input data related to IP classes.
- **IP-Subnet-Checker-Excel-Macro**: Excel-based macro script for validating subnets.
- **IP-VLAN-CIDR-Generator**: Tool to generate VLAN configurations and CIDR mappings.
- **IP-and-Subnet-Masking-Tool**: Scripts to calculate subnet masks and perform subnetting operations.
- **NMAP parts scan**: Python script for splitting Nmap scan scope for large-scale assessments.
- **Nessus Credentials Validator**: Validator for Nessus credentialed scan configurations.
- **Subnet Analyser - Subnet to IP Converter**: Converts subnet notations to IP ranges.
- **Table-Maker-For-INVA-INPT-SegPT**: VBS script to generate formatted tables from raw segmentation data.

### Additional Tools
Also included are useful zip files for common pentesting tools:
- `ike-scan-win32-1.9.zip`
- `sqlmap-1.9.zip`
- `sslscan-2.1.6.zip`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status

**This Project is in Testing Phase**  
Some scripts may still be under development or require refinement.

## üìÅ Usage

Each folder contains a `README.md` or comments in code for guidance on usage. Make sure to inspect and test scripts in a controlled environment before deploying in production environments.
