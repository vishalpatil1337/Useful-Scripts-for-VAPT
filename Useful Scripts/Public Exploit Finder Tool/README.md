# 🔍 Public Exploit Finder Tool

This tool helps automatically identify **publicly available exploits** for a given list of CVEs. It searches across a curated set of high-confidence security domains including Exploit-DB, GitHub, 0day.today, PacketStorm, Seebug, and many more.

---

## ✅ Features

- Searches across 40+ security-focused domains
- Uses CVE-based fuzzy matching
- Calculates **exploit probability score** (0–100)
- Highlights keywords in URLs, titles, and descriptions
- Outputs links with high probability of containing real exploits

---

## 📂 File Structure

- `exploit_finder.py`: Main Python script
- `scope.txt`: Input file with list of CVEs
- `output.txt`: Output file with exploit candidates (optional)
- `README.md`: This help file

---

## 📥 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `colorama` library

Install required package:

```bash
pip install colorama
```

---

## 🧾 Usage

1. **Create `scope.txt` file** with each CVE on a new line:

```
CVE-2023-44487
CVE-2024-0204
CVE-2021-3156
```

2. **Run the script**:

```bash
python exploit_finder.py
```

3. **Output**: The tool will search known exploit domains and print URLs with confidence scores. You can optionally redirect results to a file:

```bash
python exploit_finder.py > output.txt
```

## 🧠 How Scoring Works

| Source / Condition                        | Score |
|------------------------------------------|-------|
| High-confidence domains (Exploit-DB, 0day.today, Seebug) | +40  |
| Medium domains (GitHub, PacketStorm)     | +25   |
| CVE present in URL (variant match)       | +20   |
| Medium-confidence domains (others)       | +15   |
| Keyword match in title/description/url   | varies|

Final score is between **0–100**. Higher the score, more likely the link is a **real working exploit**.
