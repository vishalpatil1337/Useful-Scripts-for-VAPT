Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must check the identity of the entity requesting the certificate, as specified in the CA's Certification Practice Statement (CPS). Thus, standard certificate validation procedures require the subject CN field of a certificate to match the actual name of the entity presenting the certificate. For example, in a certificate presented by ""https://www.example.com/"", the CN should be ""www.example.com"". 

In order to detect and prevent active eavesdropping attacks, the validity of a certificate must be verified, or else an attacker could then launch a man-in-the-middle attack and gain full control of the data stream. Of particular importance is the validity of the subject's CN, that should match the name of the entity (hostname).

A CN mismatch most often occurs due to a configuration error, though it can also indicate that a man-in-the-middle attack is being conducted.","Fix the subject's Common Name (CN) field in the certificate

 The subject's common name (CN) field in the X.509 certificate should be fixed to reflect the name of the entity presenting the certificate (e.g., the hostname).

10.18.13.9,ip-10-18-13-9.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal,tcp,443,4,OpenSSL vulnerability (CVE-2022-4450),"The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the ""name"" (e.g. ""CERTIFICATE""), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the ""name_out"", ""header"" and ""data"" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.","* Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.1.1t

10.18.13.9,ip-10-18-13-9.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal,tcp,80,4,OpenSSL vulnerability (CVE-2022-4450),"The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the ""name"" (e.g. ""CERTIFICATE""), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the ""name_out"", ""header"" and ""data"" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.","* Upgrade to OpenSSL version 1.1.1t

The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.

An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them.

Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must check the identity of the entity requesting the certificate, as specified in the CA's Certification Practice Statement (CPS). Thus, standard certificate validation procedures require the subject CN field of a certificate to match the actual name of the entity presenting the certificate. For example, in a certificate presented by ""https://www.example.com/"", the CN should be ""www.example.com"". 

In order to detect and prevent active eavesdropping attacks, the validity of a certificate must be verified, or else an attacker could then launch a man-in-the-middle attack and gain full control of the data stream. Of particular importance is the validity of the subject's CN, that should match the name of the entity (hostname).

A CN mismatch most often occurs due to a configuration error, though it can also indicate that a man-in-the-middle attack is being conducted.","Fix the subject's Common Name (CN) field in the certificate

 The subject's common name (CN) field in the X.509 certificate should be fixed to reflect the name of the entity presenting the certificate (e.g., the hostname).

 If exploited, this attack can potentially allow an attacker to recover up to 32 bits of plaintext from an arbitrary block of ciphertext from a connection secured using the SSH protocol in the standard configuration. If OpenSSH is used in the standard configuration, then the attacker's success probability for recovering 32 bits of plaintext is 2^{-18}.

10.18.13.9,ip-10-18-13-9.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal,tcp,80,5,OpenSSL vulnerability (CVE-2022-0778),"The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop.

Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must check the identity of the entity requesting the certificate, as specified in the CA's Certification Practice Statement (CPS). Thus, standard certificate validation procedures require the subject CN field of a certificate to match the actual name of the entity presenting the certificate. For example, in a certificate presented by ""https://www.example.com/"", the CN should be ""www.example.com"". 

In order to detect and prevent active eavesdropping attacks, the validity of a certificate must be verified, or else an attacker could then launch a man-in-the-middle attack and gain full control of the data stream. Of particular importance is the validity of the subject's CN, that should match the name of the entity (hostname).

A CN mismatch most often occurs due to a configuration error, though it can also indicate that a man-in-the-middle attack is being conducted.","Fix the subject's Common Name (CN) field in the certificate

 The subject's common name (CN) field in the X.509 certificate should be fixed to reflect the name of the entity presenting the certificate (e.g., the hostname).

10.18.13.9,ip-10-18-13-9.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal,tcp,443,6,OpenSSL vulnerability (CVE-2021-3712),"ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own ""d2i"" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the ""data"" and ""length"" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the ""data"" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext).

Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the ""out"" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the ""outlen"" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the ""out"" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash.

Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must check the identity of the entity requesting the certificate, as specified in the CA's Certification Practice Statement (CPS). Thus, standard certificate validation procedures require the subject CN field of a certificate to match the actual name of the entity presenting the certificate. For example, in a certificate presented by ""https://www.example.com/"", the CN should be ""www.example.com"". 

In order to detect and prevent active eavesdropping attacks, the validity of a certificate must be verified, or else an attacker could then launch a man-in-the-middle attack and gain full control of the data stream. Of particular importance is the validity of the subject's CN, that should match the name of the entity (hostname).

A CN mismatch most often occurs due to a configuration error, though it can also indicate that a man-in-the-middle attack is being conducted.","Fix the subject's Common Name (CN) field in the certificate

 The subject's common name (CN) field in the X.509 certificate should be fixed to reflect the name of the entity presenting the certificate (e.g., the hostname).

Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must check the identity of the entity requesting the certificate, as specified in the CA's Certification Practice Statement (CPS). Thus, standard certificate validation procedures require the subject CN field of a certificate to match the actual name of the entity presenting the certificate. For example, in a certificate presented by ""https://www.example.com/"", the CN should be ""www.example.com"". 

In order to detect and prevent active eavesdropping attacks, the validity of a certificate must be verified, or else an attacker could then launch a man-in-the-middle attack and gain full control of the data stream. Of particular importance is the validity of the subject's CN, that should match the name of the entity (hostname).

A CN mismatch most often occurs due to a configuration error, though it can also indicate that a man-in-the-middle attack is being conducted.","Fix the subject's Common Name (CN) field in the certificate

 The subject's common name (CN) field in the X.509 certificate should be fixed to reflect the name of the entity presenting the certificate (e.g., the hostname). This is done by generating a new certificate usually signed by a Certification Authority (CA) trusted by both the client and server.","The subject common name found in the X.509 certificate does not seem to match the scan target:

The use of a self-signed certificate is not recommended since it could indicate that a TLS/SSL man-in-the-middle attack is taking place","Obtain a new certificate from your CA and ensure the server configuration is correct


 Ensure the common name (CN) reflects the name of the entity presenting the certificate (e.g., the hostname). If the certificate(s) or any of the chain certificate(s) have expired or been revoked, obtain a new certificate from your Certificate Authority (CA) by following their documentation.

10.18.13.9,ip-10-18-13-9.ap-southeast-1.compute.internal,tcp,443,3,TLS/SSL Server Is Using Commonly Used Prime Numbers,The server is using a common or default prime number as a parameter during the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This makes the secure session vulnerable to a precomputation attack. An attacker can spend a significant amount of time to generate a lookup/rainbow table for a particular prime number. This lookup table can then be used to obtain the shared secret for the handshake and decrypt the session.,"Generate random Diffie-Hellman parameters


 Configure the server to use a randomly generated Diffie-Hellman group. It's recommend that you generate a 2048-bit group. The simplest way of generating a new group is to use OpenSSL: 

 openssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem 2048 

 To use the DH parameters in newer versions of Apache (2.4.8 and newer) and OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later, you can directly specify your DH params file as follows: 

 SSLOpenSSLConfCmd DHParameters ""{path to dhparams.pem}"" 

 If you are using Apache with LibreSSL, or Apache 2.4.7 and OpenSSL 0.9.8a or later, you can append the DHparams you generated earlier to the end of your certificate file and reload the configuration.

The security of a block cipher is often reduced to the key size k: the best attack should be the exhaustive search of the key, with complexity 2 to the power of k. However, the block size n is also an important security parameter, defining the amount of data that can be encrypted under the same key. This is particularly important when using common modes of operation: we require block ciphers to be secure with up to 2 to the power of n queries, but most modes of operation (e.g. CBC, CTR, GCM, OCB, etc.) are unsafe with more than 2 to the power of half n blocks of message (the birthday bound). With a modern block cipher with 128-bit blocks such as AES, the birthday bound corresponds to 256 exabytes.

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

       ipchains -A input -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP

       ipchains -A output -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.","* Apache Tomcat >= 7.0 and < 7.0.100

      IRIX does not offer a way to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using ipfilterd, and/or block it at any external firewalls.

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Linux
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Linux

      
      Linux offers neither a sysctl nor a /proc/sys/net/ipv4 interface to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using iptables, and/or block it at the firewall. For example:

       ipchains -A input -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP

       ipchains -A output -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      See Cisco's support document  Handling ICMP Pings with the PIX Firewall (http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/110/31.html)  for more information.

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      Note that it is generally preferable to use ACLs that block everything by default and then selectively allow certain types of traffic in. For example, block everything and then only allow ICMP unreachable, ICMP echo reply, ICMP time exceeded, and ICMP source quench:

       permit icmp any any unreachable

       permit icmp any any echo-reply

       permit icmp any any time-exceeded

      Linux offers neither a sysctl nor a /proc/sys/net/ipv4 interface to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using iptables, and/or block it at the firewall. For example:

       ipchains -A input -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP

       ipchains -A output -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Linux
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Linux

      
      Linux offers neither a sysctl nor a /proc/sys/net/ipv4 interface to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using iptables, and/or block it at the firewall. For example:

       ipchains -A input -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP

       ipchains -A output -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Windows NT 4

      
      Windows NT 4 does not provide a way to block ICMP packets. Therefore, you should block them at the firewall.

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      See Cisco's support document  Handling ICMP Pings with the PIX Firewall (http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/110/31.html)  for more information.

      Use the IPSec filter feature to define and apply an IP filter list that blocks ICMP types 13 and 14. Note that the standard TCP/IP blocking capability under the ""Networking and Dialup Connections"" control panel is NOT capable of blocking ICMP (only TCP and UDP). The IPSec filter features, while they may seem strictly related to the IPSec standards, will allow you to selectively block these ICMP packets. See  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190  for more information.

       deny icmp any any 14

      Note that it is generally preferable to use ACLs that block everything by default and then selectively allow certain types of traffic in. For example, block everything and then only allow ICMP unreachable, ICMP echo reply, ICMP time exceeded, and ICMP source quench:

       permit icmp any any unreachable

       permit icmp any any echo-reply

       permit icmp any any time-exceeded

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

This lookup table can then be used to obtain the shared secret for the handshake and decrypt the session.,"Generate random Diffie-Hellman parameters


 Configure the server to use a randomly generated Diffie-Hellman group. It's recommend that you generate a 2048-bit group. The simplest way of generating a new group is to use OpenSSL: 

 openssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem 2048 

 To use the DH parameters in newer versions of Apache (2.4.8 and newer) and OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later, you can directly specify your DH params file as follows: 

 SSLOpenSSLConfCmd DHParameters ""{path to dhparams.pem}"" 

 If you are using Apache with LibreSSL, or Apache 2.4.7 and OpenSSL 0.9.8a or later, you can append the DHparams you generated earlier to the end of your certificate file and reload the configuration.

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface.

Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must check the identity of the entity requesting the certificate, as specified in the CA's Certification Practice Statement (CPS). Thus, standard certificate validation procedures require the subject CN field of a certificate to match the actual name of the entity presenting the certificate. For example, in a certificate presented by ""https://www.example.com/"", the CN should be ""www.example.com"". 

In order to detect and prevent active eavesdropping attacks, the validity of a certificate must be verified, or else an attacker could then launch a man-in-the-middle attack and gain full control of the data stream. Of particular importance is the validity of the subject's CN, that should match the name of the entity (hostname).

A CN mismatch most often occurs due to a configuration error, though it can also indicate that a man-in-the-middle attack is being conducted.","Fix the subject's Common Name (CN) field in the certificate

 The subject's common name (CN) field in the X.509 certificate should be fixed to reflect the name of the entity presenting the certificate (e.g., the hostname). This is done by generating a new certificate usually signed by a Certification Authority (CA) trusted by both the client and server.","The subject common name found in the X.509 certificate does not seem to match the scan target:

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * OpenBSD
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on OpenBSD

      
      Set the ""net.inet.icmp.tstamprepl"" sysctl variable to 0.

       sysctl -w net.inet.icmp.tstamprepl=0

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      See Cisco's support document  Handling ICMP Pings with the PIX Firewall (http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/110/31.html)  for more information.

      Use the IPSec filter feature to define and apply an IP filter list that blocks ICMP types 13 and 14. Note that the standard TCP/IP blocking capability under the ""Networking and Dialup Connections"" control panel is NOT capable of blocking ICMP (only TCP and UDP). The IPSec filter features, while they may seem strictly related to the IPSec standards, will allow you to selectively block these ICMP packets. See  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190  for more information.

In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      See Cisco's support document  Handling ICMP Pings with the PIX Firewall (http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/110/31.html)  for more information.

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

      Use the IPSec filter feature to define and apply an IP filter list that blocks ICMP types 13 and 14. Note that the standard TCP/IP blocking capability under the ""Networking and Dialup Connections"" control panel is NOT capable of blocking ICMP (only TCP and UDP). The IPSec filter features, while they may seem strictly related to the IPSec standards, will allow you to selectively block these ICMP packets.

This makes the secure session vulnerable to a precomputation attack. An attacker can spend a significant amount of time to generate a lookup/rainbow table for a particular prime number. This lookup table can then be used to obtain the shared secret for the handshake and decrypt the session.,"Generate random Diffie-Hellman parameters


 Configure the server to use a randomly generated Diffie-Hellman group. It's recommend that you generate a 2048-bit group. The simplest way of generating a new group is to use OpenSSL: 

 openssl dhparam -out dhparams.pem 2048 

 To use the DH parameters in newer versions of Apache (2.4.8 and newer) and OpenSSL 1.0.2 or later, you can directly specify your DH params file as follows: 

 SSLOpenSSLConfCmd DHParameters ""{path to dhparams.pem}"" 

 If you are using Apache with LibreSSL, or Apache 2.4.7 and OpenSSL 0.9.8a or later, you can append the DHparams you generated earlier to the end of your certificate file and reload the configuration.

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      Linux offers neither a sysctl nor a /proc/sys/net/ipv4 interface to disable ICMP timestamp responses. Therefore, you should block ICMP on the affected host using iptables, and/or block it at the firewall. For example:

       ipchains -A input -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP

       ipchains -A output -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition, Microsoft Windows NT Server, Terminal Server Edition

 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must check the identity of the entity requesting the certificate, as specified in the CA's Certification Practice Statement (CPS). Thus, standard certificate validation procedures require the subject CN field of a certificate to match the actual name of the entity presenting the certificate. For example, in a certificate presented by ""https://www.example.com/"", the CN should be ""www.example.com"". 

In order to detect and prevent active eavesdropping attacks, the validity of a certificate must be verified, or else an attacker could then launch a man-in-the-middle attack and gain full control of the data stream. Of particular importance is the validity of the subject's CN, that should match the name of the entity (hostname).

A CN mismatch most often occurs due to a configuration error, though it can also indicate that a man-in-the-middle attack is being conducted.","Fix the subject's Common Name (CN) field in the certificate

 The subject's common name (CN) field in the X.509 certificate should be fixed to reflect the name of the entity presenting the certificate (e.g., the hostname).

Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

       ipchains -A input -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-request -j DROP

       ipchains -A output -p icmp --icmp-type timestamp-reply -j DROP

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Windows NT 4

      
      Windows NT 4 does not provide a way to block ICMP packets. Therefore, you should block them at the firewall.

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).

      Set the ""net.inet.icmp.tstamprepl"" sysctl variable to 0.

       sysctl -w net.inet.icmp.tstamprepl=0

      The easiest and most effective solution is to configure your firewall to block incoming and outgoing ICMP packets with ICMP types 13 (timestamp request) and 14 (timestamp response).



 * Cisco PIX
      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Cisco PIX

      
      A properly configured PIX firewall should never respond to ICMP packets on its external interface. In PIX Software versions 4.1(6) until 5.2.1, ICMP traffic to the PIX's internal interface is permitted; the PIX cannot be configured to NOT respond. Beginning in PIX Software version 5.2.1, ICMP is still permitted on the internal interface by default, but ICMP responses from its internal interfaces can be disabled with the icmp command, as follows, where <inside> is the name of the internal interface:

       icmp deny any 13 <inside>

       icmp deny any 14 <inside>

      Don't forget to save the configuration when you are finished.

      See Cisco's support document  Handling ICMP Pings with the PIX Firewall (http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/110/31.html)  for more information.

      Disable ICMP timestamp responses on Windows 2000

      
      Use the IPSec filter feature to define and apply an IP filter list that blocks ICMP types 13 and 14. Note that the standard TCP/IP blocking capability under the ""Networking and Dialup Connections"" control panel is NOT capable of blocking ICMP (only TCP and UDP). The IPSec filter features, while they may seem strictly related to the IPSec standards, will allow you to selectively block these ICMP packets. See  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190  for more information.

Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must check the identity of the entity requesting the certificate, as specified in the CA's Certification Practice Statement (CPS). Thus, standard certificate validation procedures require the subject CN field of a certificate to match the actual name of the entity presenting the certificate. For example, in a certificate presented by ""https://www.example.com/"", the CN should be ""www.example.com"". 

In order to detect and prevent active eavesdropping attacks, the validity of a certificate must be verified, or else an attacker could then launch a man-in-the-middle attack and gain full control of the data stream. Of particular importance is the validity of the subject's CN, that should match the name of the entity (hostname).

A CN mismatch most often occurs due to a configuration error, though it can also indicate that a man-in-the-middle attack is being conducted.","Fix the subject's Common Name (CN) field in the certificate

 The subject's common name (CN) field in the X.509 certificate should be fixed to reflect the name of the entity presenting the certificate (e.g., the hostname). This is done by generating a new certificate usually signed by a Certification Authority (CA) trusted by both the client and server.","The subject common name found in the X.509 certificate does not seem to match the scan target:
